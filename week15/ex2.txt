There are 3 strategies of dealing with deadlocks:
- recovery
- prevention
- avoidance

1) Recovery. Let deadlocks occur, detect them, and take action. Possible methods (Preemption, Rollback, Killing processes)
Recovery through killing process is  the simplest strategy, therefore it might be better than others if we want to solve problem extremely fast. However, we should carefully choose "victim".
2) Avoidance by careful resource allocation. We should use this method when the system will not enter an unsafe state.
3) Prevention, by structurally negating one of the four required conditions. (Mutual-Exclusion, Hold-and-Wait, No-Preemption, Circular wait). 
We should use this strategy when we are sure that at least one of the required conditions for creating deadlock will never be met.
