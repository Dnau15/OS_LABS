We can construct the following sequences:
1) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1... It will result in increased Hit/Miss ratio.
2) 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7... It will result in decreased Hit/Miss ratio.
In the first case we always hit(except the first time). Firstly, we have empty memory. Then we put 1 in our memory and then we 
are looking for 1 in our memory. We have found 1 in our memory. It's hit. OK. We will do the same thing many times.
Therefore, our ratio will increase each time.
In the second case we always miss(except the second and third time). As I said before, firstly we have empty memory. Then we put 1 in our 
memory and then we are looking for 1. We have found 1. It's hit. Then we read next reference. It's 1. We have found 1 in our memory. It's hit. Then we 
read next reference. We are looking for 2. We have not found it in our memory. Therefore, it's miss. We increase miss rate. And then we do the same thing, 
as with 2, with 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
Therefore, our ratio will decrease each time.
